## 🔑 Getting API Keys & Credentials

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the **Project Selector** (top-left dropdown)
3. Click **"NEW PROJECT"**
4. Enter a project name: `AI Email Summarizer` (or any name)
5. Click **"CREATE"**
6. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few moments)

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

#### Enable Gmail API:
1. In the Cloud Console, search for **"Gmail API"**
2. Click on **"Gmail API"** from the results
3. Click **"ENABLE"**
4. Wait for it to be enabled

#### Enable Google Gemini/Generative AI API:
1. Search for **"Generative Language API"** (or "Gemini API")
2. Click on it from the results
3. Click **"ENABLE"**

### Important: Gmail API & OAuth scopes (required)

Before the app can read or draft messages from a Gmail account, you must enable the Gmail API for the SAME Google Cloud project that contains your OAuth credentials. Also ensure the OAuth consent screen and test users are configured while you are developing or distributing the app.

- Required scopes the app may request (add these when configuring your OAuth consent or when the app requests access):
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` — read messages
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose` — create and send draft messages
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` — (optional) modify labels or mark messages as read

- Notes for distribution (CodeCanyon / buyers):
   - Make sure buyers understand they must enable the **Gmail API** in their own Google Cloud project and create OAuth credentials (desktop application) to use the app.
   - If the OAuth consent screen is set to **External**, add any tester accounts to the **Test users** list while testing. For a public release you may need to submit the app for verification if you request sensitive scopes.
   - The `credentials.json` you download from the Cloud Console must come from the same project where Gmail API was enabled.

Test these steps locally by downloading `credentials.json` and using the app's Setup Screen to upload it, then click **Login** to authorize Gmail access.

### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. In the Cloud Console sidebar, go to **"Credentials"**
2. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** (top button)
3. Select **"OAuth client ID"**
4. If prompted, configure the consent screen first:
   - Click **"CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"**
   - Select **"External"** (for personal use)
   - Click **"CREATE"**
   - Fill in the details:
   - **App name**: `AI Email Summarizer`
     - **User support email**: (your email)
     - **Developer contact**: (your email)
   - Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"**
   - You can skip the scopes (just click "SAVE AND CONTINUE")
   - Click **"SAVE AND CONTINUE"** on test users
   - Click **"BACK TO DASHBOARD"**

5. Now create OAuth credentials:
   - Go to **"Credentials"** again
   - Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"**
   - Select **"OAuth client ID"**
   - Choose **"Desktop application"**
   - Click **"CREATE"**
   - You'll see a popup with your credentials - click **"DOWNLOAD JSON"**
   - Save this file as **`credentials.json`** in the app folder

### Step 4: Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click **"Get API Key"** (or **"Create API Key"**)
3. Select **"Create API key in new project"**
4. Copy the API key (looks like: `AIzaSy...`)
5. Keep it safe - you'll enter it in the app's setup screen

## 📦 Packaging & Icons for Distribution (CodeCanyon)

If you plan to sell or distribute this app on CodeCanyon, follow these recommendations to provide a professional, user-friendly package.

- Recommended distribution: build a single Windows EXE with your icon embedded. This looks polished and avoids shipping a raw `credentials.json` or `.bat` file.

- Build with PyInstaller (example):

```powershell
# Install PyInstaller if needed
python -m pip install --user pyinstaller

# From the project root (where app.py and icon.ico live)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "AI Email Summarizer" --icon=icon.ico app.py
```

- After building:
   - The output `dist\AI Email Summarizer.exe` is the distributable. Test it on a clean Windows machine.
   - Include `icon.ico` in your source package so buyers can recompile if desired.

- If you prefer to keep the launcher as a batch file:
   - Distribute a ready-made shortcut (`.lnk`) that points to the `.bat` and uses `icon.ico` (or provide a PowerShell script to create the shortcut automatically).
   - Or use a GUI tool like **Bat To Exe Converter** to convert the `.bat` to an EXE and embed the icon during conversion.

- Icon guidance:
   - Provide a multi-size `.ico` file containing 16×16, 32×32, 48×48, and 256×256 layers.
   - Use a simple, high-contrast glyph so it remains legible at 16×16.
   - Name it `icon.ico` and place it at the project root.

- CodeCanyon packaging checklist (suggested files to include for buyers):
   - `AI Email Summarizer.exe` (or `dist/` build files) — the runnable app
   - `README.md` — installation and API setup instructions
   - `LICENSE.txt` — licensing information
   - `icon.ico` — icon file used for the build
   - `credentials.example.json` — example OAuth JSON structure (do NOT include your real `credentials.json`)
   - `setup_instructions.txt` — short one-page steps for buyers (create project, enable Gmail API, create OAuth credentials, get Gemini API key)

- Distribution notes and legal/security reminders:
   - Do NOT ship your personal `credentials.json` or any API keys. Buyers must create their own Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials.
   - If you request sensitive scopes (Gmail write/modify), advise buyers that Google may require OAuth verification for public apps.
   - Provide clear instructions in the purchase bundle explaining how to create the `credentials.json` and where to paste the Gemini API key.

Test the packaged app thoroughly: login flow, email loading, summarization, and generating drafts. Verify the icon appears correctly in Explorer, on the taskbar, and in Start Menu shortcuts.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Error: credentials.json not found"
- **Solution**: Upload your credentials.json file in the Setup Screen
- Get it from: Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Download JSON

### "Invalid API Key"
- **Solution**: Check your Gemini API key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)
- Ensure the key is enabled for the Generative Language API

### "No emails appear after clicking Load"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check if you have unread emails in Gmail
  - Try changing the email count (2, 3, 5, etc.)
  - Make sure Gmail API is enabled in Cloud Console

### "Gmail login keeps failing"
- **Solution**:
  - Delete `gmail_token.pkl` file from the app directory
  - Restart the app
  - Try logging in again
  - Make sure "Less secure app access" is enabled (if using older Google accounts)

### "Summarization is very slow"
- **Solution**:
  - Gemini API has rate limits on free tier
  - Wait a few minutes between summaries
  - Consider upgrading your API plan

### "App crashes on startup"
- **Solution**:
  - Reinstall Python dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
  - Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
  - Check that `config.py` exists in the app folder
